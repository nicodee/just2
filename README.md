At the moment there are 9  pages. 
  - Home page "index.html"
  - Sign-up page "signup.html"
  - Profile page "home.html"
  - Answers page "answers.html" contains answers a user has given to various questions
  - Questions page "questions.html" contains questions a user has asked on the platform so far
  - Following page "following.html" contains all the users a particular user is following 
  - Followers page "followers.html" conatins all the followers of a user
  - Inbox page "inbox.html" 
  - Game page "game.html" user initiates a game here
  
Each one of the pages has a corresponding ".js" and ".css" file

What we need to do:
  - Ensure that the various pages have a demo-ready look and feel
  - Ensure that they have dynamic content (using javascript where we can) that represents the flow of the idea (game play)

I'll like you guys to go through it and decide which pages you want to work on so we can get going. 
And also let us inform each other on what we are individually working on to avoid conflict.
